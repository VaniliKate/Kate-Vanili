                        <h2>Kate Vanili</h2>
                            <p>I am a <em>programming enthusisast</em> studying at <a href="`https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> hoping to break even in the tech industry as a <strong>professional</strong>.</p>
                            <p>I was previously a design student at <a href="https://tukenya.ac.ke/">The Technical University of Kenya</a> before I decided that I wanted to break into a tech career.</p>
                            <p>Having only began coding and still being very green, I have no prior experience in the field,but hope to be employable in the job market at the end of my course.</p>
                            <p>I have a strong affinity towards programming because I love to solve problems, I like to always be on a learning curve, and programming will give me room to explore all the potential there is within me in that regards.</p>
                            <p>Other than programming, I love to write short stories, make and edit videos, I also love podcasting and I'm quite obsessed with fitness as it acts as an escape when things get tough.</p>
